        <p>Our core values at the CC Lab are:</p>
        <p>1. Transparency: We value the free exchange of scientific ideas and open discussions about data and what it represents. Questions about your project, thesis and data are welcome at all times. We believe transparency is essential for both for fruitful collaboration and for scientific advancement.</p>
        <p>2. Collaboration: Each lab member retains complete ownership of their work, and, as a researcher, is expected to contribute intellectually to all other projects in the group - either formally during lab meetings or informally while working together. It is important that everyone knows what everyone else is doing, why and how they are doing it, and understanding the intersections between the projects in the lab - outside perspectives help one's own research and growth. We believe that collaboration stems from direct, open and honest communication, which is an essential part of working at the CC Lab. We see respectful criticism and the conflict of ideas as key for meaningful scientific advance.</p>
        <p>3. Growth: We all share the love for science and all of us - from the most inexperienced member to the most knowledgeable - are subject to making mistakes at any given moment. At the CC Lab, we believe that understanding our misconceptions, accepting and taking responsibility for mistakes are an important part of the learning process. </p>
        <p>At the CC Lab you are expected to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid assumptions - ask questions.</li>
          <li>Collaborate and contribute to your colleagues' work</li>
          <li>Be respectful and honest</li>
          <li>Give (and accept) constructive criticism</li>
          <li>Be thorough with your research</li>
          <li>Be transparent about your mistakes and misconceptions</li>
        </ul>
